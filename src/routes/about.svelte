            I am a lifelong learner and a proud product of the Philippine public
            school system! I went to Manila Science High School, then the
            University of the Philippines Diliman for my pre-law and law
            degrees. I have worked in government and in the international
            development scene for more than a decade until life happened, I
            became a mom to 2 adorable kids and Iâ€™ve undergone a lot of mindset
            shifts. I became a mompreneur, became involved in mom-related
            advocacies, and explored my options. I am currently enjoying life as
            a self-employed boss mama at The Oil Natural Project, tribe leader
            to thousands of Young Living Essential Oil users, and community
            builder and co-founder of Fit Moms Project Ph and Pinay Girl Boss.

            After graduating from the University of the Philippines Diliman, I
            moved back to Saudi Arabia where I started my career in the aviation
            industry in 2010. I am a dreamer, I am an unconventional mom, I
            enjoy getting lost in books, I believe that meals are not complete
            without dessert and I love traveling the world with my family. I am
            the other half of Pinay Girl Boss and proud boss mama of the
            Certified Oilers community.
